# Rust-Bundles-Pre-Loader
I just wrote a little console application that pre-loads the Rust assets/bundles
directly to your Memory in a faster way than Rust itself does.
Rust Bundles Pre-Loader does almost the same thing as RAMDisk but, only loads the assets which are the biggest files.
And doesn't make virtual Ram drives. It basically puts the files in your Memory for Rust to pick it up.
The same thing happens when you start Rust and close it.
The Assets will still be in your Memory so you can load Rust faster at later time (without rebooting ofcourse).
